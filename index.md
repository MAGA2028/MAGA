### Road Map

Below you can find a light version of our milestones for the upcoming period.

  ##  Q1-2022
      #New Launchpad model: MAGA-LOTTERY
      
      An innovative and win-win Launchpad concept boosting the MAGA DAO Treasury while ensuring the launched project
      succeeds long term.
      
      #MAGA Cross-Chain
      
      The MAGA Reserve Fund, receiving 25% of all MAGA token emissions, allows MAGA to expand cross-chain easily and
      efficiently. We will target promissing L2 chains trying to become an AMM leader.
      
      #Governance
      
      MAGA holders will vote on many decisions from the team and also community suggestions on Discord. We will release
      a governance structure to make voting efficient for everyone.
      
   
   ## Q2-2022
   
      #RWnB Multi-Asset
        
       Minting in addition to minting the RWnB stable coin with MIM tokens, users of the MAGA platform will now be able
       to mint RWnB with multiple assets, such as BTC, ETH, etc.
       
      
      #RWnB Multi-Chain
       
       The RWnB stable coin will become useable not only on the Fantom Network, but on many other chains to facilitate its
       massive adoption, strengthening the entire MAGA ecosystem.
       
       
  
#### Risks

Although there are multiple safety precautions in place, farming and participating in DeFi comes with certain potential risks.

Below, we briefly present the potential risks associated with using the MAGA platform

  ##  Risks to Yield Farmers
 
    # Impermanent Loss (IL):
    
      - Risk of (impermanent) capital loss from asset re-balancing in the Automated Market Maker ("AMM") pool.
      
      - Stable coin pairs can be subject to impermanent loss, if the price of at least one moves off peg. In general, the Impermanent Loss (IL) from this movement is         small and transient. Historically, however, there have been instances where stable coins have stayed off-peg for extended periods of time. By opening                 a position with large leverage, you are also amplifying the potential IL on your principal

    # Mitigation:
    
     -  Impermanent loss is not unique to our protocol. It is common among all yield farming and AMMs. While itâ€™s not possible to completely mitigate IL,                     users can choose to yield farm asset pairs that have high correlations to minimize potential IL.
     
   
   ## Smart Contract Risks
   
    # Risk:
      
      - While the majority of our smart contracts have been audited by multiple third-party firms, they could in theory have vulnerabilities.
      
      
    # Mitigation:
    
      - Having smart contracts audited by multiple professional third-party firms decreases the chance of vulnerabilities.
      
    
While we do our best to eliminate all the possible risks, DeFi is an industry where events that no one predicted can occur. We recommend that users only risk assets that they can afford to lose. We assure you that the team works tirelessly to protect users' funds though. Users should do the same.
